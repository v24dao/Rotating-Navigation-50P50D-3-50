## About the course

#### Why I am completing this course?

- To maintain a high level of familiarity with vanilla HTML & CSS, whilst working on other projects that use Bootstrap and TailwindCSS.
- To learn about new JavaScript concepts and to actively apply the JavScript concepts which I already know.

#### My approach to the projects in this course

In regards to the JavaScript portions of these projects, I aim to complete as much as possible without reference to the corresponding videos.

I shall utilise resources such as [google](https://www.google.co.uk), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and my own notes.

Upon completion of each project, I shall compare my solution with Brad's and write about:

- What I have learnt from the project
- Resources which have helped me (if any)
- Any plans for continued development
